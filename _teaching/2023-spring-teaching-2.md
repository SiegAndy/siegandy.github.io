Course Objective
======
This course provides an introduction to fundamentals and high-level concepts of the design and implementation of technologies that provide us with A Connected World; a world in our hand. This technology as a whole, enables us to reach the furthest point of the Planet Earth, and for that matter, the space surrounding it (of course, if the technology is enabled in the far end point). While we will mostly focus on the technical foundation of these technologies, we will also cover, to the extent possible, the social, policy, and economic aspect of these technologies. To achieve concrete learning results, we will focus on the current Internet and will learn the building blocks that bring the word at our reach.
