Project experience
======
* *Autoencoder Optimization - Amherst, MA - 2022-2023*
  * Software Engineer - Back-End (Python, Deep Learning, MLP, CNN, RNN)	
  * Contribution:
    * Developed an **autoencoder** with a **backpropagation** mechanism to effectively denoise individual heartbeats from electrocardiogram signals, enhancing signal quality and accuracy.
    * Performed a comprehensive comparison between linear and non-linear structures, including **CNN** and **RNN**, to evaluate their performance in optimizing the denoising process. 
    * Employed academic research methodologies to methodically **fine-tune** autoencoder model parameters, incorporating strategies like **scheduled learning rate** adjustments and varied **layer structures**, resulting in elevated denoising capabilities and heightened accuracy.
    

* *Wuhuu Information Sharing Platform - Amherst, MA - 2022-2023*
  * Software Engineer - Back-End (Python, Crawler, AWS S3)	
  * Contribution:
    * Developed customized **crawlers** utilizing Python to systematically gather data from social platforms, focusing on user engagement trends, content popularity, and sentiment analysis.
    * Implemented a robust storage infrastructure using **AWS S3** to securely store and retrieve shared files, while optimizing data retrieval and minimizing latency.


* *FFIV Ultimate Simulator - Amherst, MA - 2022-2023*
  * Lead Developer - Full-Stack (Unity, C#, WPF, UI/UX, XAML)	
  * Contribution:
    * Spearheaded the design and construction of a **Unity** game simulator, employing **C#** to enable players to customize and personalize their gameplay tactics allowing them to practice and refine their strategies.
