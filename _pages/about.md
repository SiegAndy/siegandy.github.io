I am a master student in computer science major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Currently, I am supervised by [Cyrus Cousins](https://cs.brown.edu/~ccousins/) and [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/people.html) on the topic of Human-AI Cooperation for Personalized Fairness Optimization. Before I apply for the master's degree, I obtained a dual Bachelor's degree in both computer science major and environmental science major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
