I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I am advised by [Razieh Negin Rahimi](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~rahimi/). My research focuses on recommendation systems and personalization.

Previously, during my master's program, I worked under the supervision of [Cyrus Cousins](https://cs.brown.edu/~ccousins/) and [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/people.html) on Human-AI Cooperation for Personalized Fairness Optimization. Prior to my master's, I earned a dual Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Environmental Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
